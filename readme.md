# Consolidation of the @britishmuseum Bronze Age Index 

This repo contains R scripts for consolidation of the British Museum's Bronze Age Index. 
These data were created through the efforts of our amazing crowdsourcing volunteers using the 
@micropasts platform. 

During project planning, we committed to depositing these data with
the UK Archaeology Data Service. This is part of that process.

# Contents

This repo contains:
 
* R Scripts (generate plots, thank you list, consolidate data, merge data, extract Flickr data, create graphs)
* The data archives (zip folders from projects)
* CSV files of raw and consolidated data, thank yous and counts. 
* GeoJSON files of consolidated data
* Plot folder - JPEG images of the maps of each BAI drawer; PNG graphs of contributions

# Usage

To use these scripts, you will need to install R on your machine. Edit the working directory line in 
each R script file (all meant to be standalone) and then execute them. They will then create folders for 
containing the maps, plots, csv, zip files and json (geo and plain). 

# License

The scripts are under MIT. The data and maps are CC-BY.
