Passmore for photographing both the dagger and the Roman objects mentioned in the preceding note. The dagger measures 6 ins. in length and 1 5/8 ins. width at the butt. It is in a remarkable state of preservation, the metal being quite uncorroded and showing yellow on one side and dark green on the other. The only injury is that a bit 3/4 in. wide in the centre of the butt which probably contained a third rivet hole is broken off, otherwise the weapon is perfect and the edges actually sharp enough still to cut a pencil with (I have just tried the experiment!). There is a prominent midrib on both sides and the edges are bevelled. A rare peculiarity is that the two rivet holes at the butt are not placed symmetrically.
